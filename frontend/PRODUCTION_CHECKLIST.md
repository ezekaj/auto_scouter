2. Upload `dist/` folder to your web server
3. Configure Nginx (use `nginx.conf`) or Apache (use `.htaccess`)
4. Set up SSL certificate
5. Test the deployment

### Option 2: Docker Deployment
1. Build Docker image: `docker build -t auto-scouter-frontend .`
2. Run container: `docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 auto-scouter-frontend`
3. Or use Docker Compose: `docker-compose up -d`

### Option 3: Static Hosting (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `npm run build`
3. Set publish directory: `dist`
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy automatically

5. **Authentication problems**: Verify JWT configuration

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check if site is accessible
curl -I https://yourdomain.com

# Test API connectivity
curl -f https://yourdomain.com/api/health

# Check SSL certificate
openssl s_client -connect yourdomain.com:443

# Monitor logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
```
