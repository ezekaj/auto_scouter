# Security Notes for Auto Scouter

## Known Security Issues

### Frontend Dependencies

#### esbuild Vulnerability (Moderate Severity)
- **Issue**: esbuild <=0.24.2 enables any website to send requests to the development server
- **CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Status**: Known issue, development-only impact
- **Impact**: Only affects development server, not production builds
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Production builds are not affected
  - Development server should only be used in trusted environments
  - Consider using `--host 127.0.0.1` for development to restrict access
- **Resolution**: Will be resolved when vite updates to use newer esbuild version

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### Backend Security
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ JWT token authentication
- ✅ SQL injection prevention with SQLAlchemy ORM
- ✅ CORS configuration for API access control
- ✅ Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- ✅ Database connection security with connection pooling
- ✅ Input validation with Pydantic schemas

### Frontend Security
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ API token management
- ✅ XSS prevention with React's built-in protections
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement in production (configurable)
- ✅ Content Security Policy support (configurable)

### Infrastructure Security
- ✅ Docker containerization with non-root user
- ✅ Health checks for service monitoring
- ✅ Log management and monitoring
- ✅ Graceful shutdown handling
- ✅ Resource limits and monitoring

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Enable HTTPS**: Set `VITE_ENABLE_HTTPS_ONLY=true` in production
2. **Configure CSP**: Set `VITE_ENABLE_STRICT_CSP=true` for content security policy
3. **Monitor Dependencies**: Regularly run `npm audit` and `pip check`
4. **Update Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated, especially security patches
5. **Environment Isolation**: Use separate environments for development, staging, and production
6. **Access Control**: Implement proper user authentication and authorization
7. **Monitoring**: Set up logging and monitoring for security events
8. **Backup Strategy**: Implement regular database backups
9. **Network Security**: Use firewalls and VPNs for production access
10. **Regular Security Audits**: Perform periodic security assessments
