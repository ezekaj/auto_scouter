## ðŸ“‹ **SCRAPING SYSTEM CLARIFICATION**

### **How Vehicle Scraping Works:**

3. **Alert Matching:** Runs every 20 minutes to check new vehicles against alerts
4. **Notifications:** Sent automatically when matches are found

### **Timeline:**
- **Vehicle Scraping:** Every 5-10 minutes (AutoUno, AutoScout24)
- **Alert Matching:** Every 20 minutes
- **Notification Processing:** Every 2 minutes
