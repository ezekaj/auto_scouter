# Alert Creation Fix Summary
**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Version:** Auto Scouter v2.0.0  
**APK:** auto_scouter_v2.0.0_fixed_alerts_20250712_1740.apk

## Issue Identified
The mobile application was showing "Error: Failed to create alert" when users attempted to create new vehicle alerts. The root cause was identified as **incorrect environment configuration**.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Environment Configuration Mismatch**: The `.env` file was still pointing to the old local backend (`http://192.168.0.35:8000/api/v1`) instead of the Supabase production endpoints.

2. **API Endpoint Mismatch**: The mobile app was trying to connect to a non-existent local server instead of the live Supabase Edge Functions.

3. **Missing Error Details**: The error handling was too generic, making it difficult to diagnose the actual issue.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Configuration Update
**File:** `auto_scouter/frontend/.env`
- ✅ Updated `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` to production Supabase instance
- ✅ Updated `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` with correct authentication key
- ✅ Updated `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to Supabase Edge Functions endpoint
- ✅ Removed old local backend references

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
**File:** `auto_scouter/frontend/src/components/alerts/AlertManager.tsx`
- ✅ Added comprehensive logging for alert creation process
- ✅ Added environment validation checks
- ✅ Added data cleaning and validation before API calls
- ✅ Added specific error message handling for different failure types
- ✅ Added detailed console logging for debugging

### 3. API Layer Improvements
**File:** `auto_scouter/frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts`
- ✅ Enhanced `vehicleAPI.createAlert()` with detailed logging
- ✅ Added request/response logging for debugging
- ✅ Added proper error parsing and user-friendly messages
- ✅ Added network error detection and handling

### 4. Code Quality Fixes
- ✅ Removed unused imports and variables
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript compilation errors
- ✅ Ensured proper build process completion

## API Verification
**Test Performed:** Direct API call to Supabase Edge Function
```bash
curl -X POST "https://rwonkzncpzirokqnuoyx.supabase.co/functions/v1/vehicle-api/alerts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [ANON_KEY]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test Mobile Alert","description":"Testing from mobile app","make":"BMW","min_price":20000,"max_price":50000}'
```
**Result:** ✅ SUCCESS - Alert created successfully with ID 4
